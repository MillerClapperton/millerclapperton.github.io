## Quality Control:

- Quality Control is one of the most important steps in this process
- Make sure label matches Panel number
- Make sure all panels are checked complete or fail
- Make sure label is placed in an appropriate area where it can be seen and not hidden, even when folded (Usually the biggest area of the panel)

- Once quality control is complete, click “All Parts Labeled and Unloaded”
- Click “Reprint” for any labels that may be damaged or unreadable

## Advanced Cutting:

- To assign multiple machines to do multiple tasks at once, click on name profile in top right corner of the program and assign to multiple cutting machines.
    - This also allows one to go back and forth between all assigned machines
    - Click on each task to go back and forth
- Dividing total time completion by number of machines running at the same time
- Make sure labels match multiple materials by job number

## Guidelines to Remember

- Always check to make sure your name is by operator. If not, assign to a cutting machine
- Follow each task as directed and do not click ahead of the assigned task
    - This causes error within the program
- Slow down and go by the manual. This will make the program and process go smoothly
- If material has not been properly laid out and reserved in the program correctly, once completed you will NOT have the opportunity to add more.
- Done tasks will show at the bottom of the task list
- <span style="color: red">DO NOT RUSH THROUGH THE PROGRAM PROCESS!!</span>
