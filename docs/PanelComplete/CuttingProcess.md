## Quality Control

- Quality Control is one of the most important steps in this process

    - This also allows one to go back and forth between all assigned machines
    - Click on each task to go back and forth
- Dividing total time completion by number of machines running at the same time
- Make sure labels match multiple materials by job number

## Guidelines to Remember

- Always check to make sure your name is by operator. If not, assign to a cutting machine
- Follow each task as directed and do not click ahead of the assigned task
    - This causes error within the program
- Slow down and go by the manual. This will make the program and process go smoothly
- If material has not been properly laid out and reserved in the program correctly, once completed you will <span style="color: red">NOT</span> have the opportunity to add more.
- Done tasks will show at the bottom of the task list
- <span style="color: red">DO NOT RUSH THROUGH THE PROGRAM PROCESS!!</span>
